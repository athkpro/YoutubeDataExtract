Together, they developed the Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS) and the Hospital Movement Tracking System (HMTS) to help manage and control the spread of the deadly disease in Singapore.

Non-intrusive and easy to use, the IFSS was deployed all across Singapore and also used by airports across Asia in their fight against SARS. The project went on to win many awards for its engineering excellence, such as the Tech Museum’s Innovation Award 2004.

Equally impressive, the HMTS reduced the contact tracing list generation time from 300 minutes to just over 30 minutes. This speedy tracing of contacts with SARS patients in hospitals was key in preventing further outbreak of the deadly disease.

First composed in 1976 as a two-stanza Midshipman song by our first batch of locally-trained midshipman to capture their aspirations of our early Navy, the song reflects on our Navy’s humble beginnings, and urges us to keep moving onwards and upwards in the service of our nation. 

A third stanza was added in 1989 by then-COL Teo Chee Hean, who was Chief of Staff – Naval Staff and Director of the Joint Operations and Planning Directorate. He felt that the fledgling navy had arrived at a point where it was writing a new chapter in its history. The new stanza reflected the growth and maturity in naval operations, which required us to work with integrate with the Army and the RSAF as an integrated force Air Force and to bring to bear, the strengths of the RSAF and the Army in the maritime domain. Unlike those in the first two stanzas, the first couplet of the new stanza does not rhyme.

The little ones dressed up as sailors as the adults tried their hands at firing a General Purpose Machine Gun. Join us as we relive the action at Changi Naval Base!

2013-01-24 09:45:02,Colours and Sounds (Naval Traditions Part 1),"The Republic of Singapore Navy, like most navies, is steeped in tradition. While it has become the 3rd Gen Navy, it still practices many naval traditions today. Part 1 of this video shows two of these traditions - the ""colours"" ceremony, and the practice of piping. These practices and their meanings are passed on from generation to generation of sailors, and serve as a common bond for the close-knit navy family.

Clarifications: The video from 00:57 onwards does not reflect the exact order of the colours ceremony. The correct order should be as follows - At 8am sharp, the time will be called out and the ship's bell will be struck 8 times. The Quartermaster will ""Pipe the Still"" with the Boatswain's Pipe. Thereafter, the crew will raise the Singapore flag at the bow and the naval ensign at the Quarterdeck of the ship.

Hi guys, we've noticed that there's quite a bit of talk about the events leading to Douglas going out-of-course (OOC). So here's more about what happened. 

Douglas' symptoms were new (when he first saw the MO), meaning that they did not show up during earlier medical checks. At that time, these symptoms hinted at a potentially serious medical condition. Because of that, the Medical Officer referred him to the hospital's A&E department immediately, for further tests and specialist reviews. In the meantime, Douglas was put on light duties as a precaution. He underwent a special heart test within two weeks, and had a specialist review with the cardiologist thereafter. The cardiologist ordered more advanced tests as the earlier tests were inconclusive. At this point, Douglas was placed out of course as he would not be able to return to training in time. Six weeks may seem like a long time, but it would have taken you and me just as long to clear the same battery of tests at the hospital. Thankfully, the additional advanced tests showed that Douglas was fine and free from the suspected medical condition.",Ministry of Defence Singapore,22,0 days 00:05:38.000000000,126703,167.0,30.0,88.0,Society;Television_program;Military,15,265.0,197.0,141.5685279187817,338.0

The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) launches their new vessel, RSS Archer, Kockums Shipyard in Karlsrona, Sweden, on 16 Jun 09. The first of two Vaastergotland-class submarines acquired from the Royal Swedish Navy (RSwN) in 2005, the range and reach of the RSS Archer has been extended with a modern suite of combat and sensor systems, which allows it to detect and engage targets from greater distances.

Requiring only 28 submariners to operate, the range and reach of the RSS Archer has been extended with a modern suite of combat and sensor systems, which allows it to detect and engage targets from greater distances. It is equipped with an Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system which enables it to stay safely submerged for longer periods, improving its endurance and stealth capabilities.

RSS Archer and her crew will return to Singapore in 2010, after undergoing extensive sea trials and tests.

This video illustrates the iTeach principle, Authentic Learning through Quality Interactions, in action in the classroom. When children are given ample opportunities to engage in sustained, shared conversations, these quality interactions expand their thinking, stimulate their creativity and enrich their learning. The teacher shares how she thoughtfully plans an authentic learning activity for the children and facilitates sustained back-and-forth exchanges to promote quality interactions with the children. In addition, we also see that quality interactions can happen beyond the classroom, even during transitions and routines!
 
The Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework is part of the NEL Curriculum, a comprehensive range of kindergarten curriculum resources developed by MOE to support early childhood educators in creating quality learning experience for children four to six years of age. For more information about the NEL Curriculum, visit the NEL Portal (https://nel.sg).

For him, running is a good metaphor for resilience – when the going gets tough, just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
 
In fact, raising resilient children starts with us – as adults – being good role models. At Montfort Junior, Mr Wong would remind parents, coaches and teachers to help students learn from their mistakes by asking, “What are the things you can do to overcome failure?”

As classically trained pianist, Mrs Lim-Tan knew the power of music in developing a child. So, one of her first acts as Principal at Yu Neng Primary was to start a school choir to help any student, harness the one musical instrument they had: their voice. 
 
Today, she has gone beyond music and the school is abuzz with student artworks and community collaborations.

2017-05-26 03:33:47,Shared Book Approach in Starlight English Language Lessons,"At the MOE Kindergartens, teachers use the Shared Book Approach to develop children’s language and literacy skills. This video shows how the Shared Book Approach is used to develop children’s listening and speaking skills through shared reading using enlarged picture books called Big Books. Children talk about the pictures in the Big Books and relate them to their own experiences. They make predictions based on what they see on each page before the teacher reads aloud. The teacher asks questions to facilitate children’s engagement with the story and helps children to attend to print and language structures. 

The general goals of the Shared Book Approach are to:
- provide an enjoyable experience with books 
- introduce beginning reading skills through motivating stories and activities 
- provide oral English models for both book and spoken language 
- encourage children to talk
- provide further language practice opportunities through rereading
- teach and reinforce basic vocabulary and language structures.

The teacher explains the importance of facilitating children’s learning by breaking down an activity into bite-size tasks, modelling the process of carrying out the task, giving clear instructions and asking open-ended questions. This also provides opportunities for children to explore, discover and gain new understanding of themselves and the world.

MOE advocates the iTeach principles outlined in the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework. The Framework is part of the NEL Curriculum, a comprehensive range of kindergarten curriculum resources developed by MOE to support early childhood educators in creating quality learning experiences for children four to six years of age. For more information about the NEL Curriculum, visit https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/preschool

2017-01-17 10:20:24,The 9 Uniformed Groups in Singapore,"Leaders of Character
The Uniformed Group Movement develops our students’ leadership potential in various ways. Leadership development courses impart to students the basics of leading others. They are regularly given opportunities to take on leadership roles, such as organising camps and events, and purposefully designing activities to help their juniors grow as individuals. The UG Movement also has a strong culture of mentorship, wherein senior members exercise care and concern for their juniors and nurture them to succeed the leadership of the unit. Through these practices, our students become youth leaders of outstanding moral fibre.
 
To Serve, and To Inspire
The Uniformed Group Movement emphasises service to the community. UG members are encouraged to look beyond oneself and to develop a spirit of compassion and care for others. They often take the initiative and use their knowledge and skills for the betterment of the wider community. They engage in advocacy work that moves others to action, and their exemplary conduct makes them role models for their peers and juniors. Thus they serve the community and inspire others to do the same.

‘T’ stands for ‘Teachers as facilitators of learning’. Early childhood educators are facilitators who plan and scaffold children’s learning based on their understanding of how children learn, their interests, needs and abilities. To further enhance children’s learning and development, early childhood educators can collaborate with families to help children make connections between what goes on in school and at home. 

MOE advocates the iTeach principles outlined in the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework. The Framework is part of the NEL Curriculum, a comprehensive range of kindergarten curriculum resources developed by MOE to support early childhood educators in creating quality learning experiences for children four to six years of age.

Through CCE Family Time activities, parents and children can decide, plan and carry out children’s contributions to the home. This includes cleaning tasks like making their beds, washing dishes or helping to clean the house.

In Punggol View Primary School, the 3-Directional Dialogue involves the child, parents and teacher at the Parent-Teacher Conferencing.   In this video, the Primary 2 students use artefacts (e.g. photographs and journals) to share their learning experiences, knowledge, values, as well as social and emotional skills acquired during the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) lessons. The teacher shares her observations of the child’s development during the PAL lessons and progress in other subject areas in Term 2. Parents also have the opportunity to find out more about their child’s social and emotional development from the teacher. The 3-Directional Dialogue provides parents with a holistic picture of the child’s learning and progress which helps them to better support their child at home.

Caring is more than an attitude, she says. It’s a set of skills. 14 years as a nurse educator has shown her that building up these skills requires learning by doing. Sometimes, a great nurse may not have done well academically, but their performance on-the-job reveals their potential.

That’s why Ms Pua feels that in her profession, “a score cannot – and must not – determine their ability to progress”. Hear how she’s worked hard to help many of her “super nurses” forge ahead in their careers. #SkillsFuture

2015-10-20 10:07:09,Voices of SkillsFuture - Choo Chiau Beng,"Mr Choo Chiau Beng is a champion for his employees. 

In a 40-year career with Keppel, Mr Choo rose from a management trainee position to CEO of Keppel Corp, where he is now a Senior Advisor. A firm believer in helping his staff stretch their potential, he helped build a culture where employees are recognised for their skills and performance, rather than academic qualifications alone.

Yesterday, we shared the video of Mr Abu Bakar, who completed his Masters degree while running a shipyard in Qatar as CEO. It was Mr Choo who had encouraged him to further build up his management skills, and wrote to the university asking if they would accept Mr Bakar without the pre-requisite degree – because he felt that Mr Bakar’s two decades of work experience and performance more than qualified him for the course. 
 
Hear Mr Choo speak about how he brings out the best in his people.

Mr Bakar worked hard to rise through the ranks – but what made the difference for him was an environment where employees weren’t judged on academic qualifications alone. “Once you’re in,” he says, “it’s about your performance. You are as good as the last project you did.”

From managing 3,000 staff at the age of 30, being sent to Qatar to start up a shipyard, to having a boss who nudged him to take on a Masters programme, Mr Bakar never stopped learning new skills – thanks to an employer who gave him the chance to him prove himself by doing. It’s taught him a principle that he applies in guiding his own staff today: that everybody can be developed into somebody. 

Hear him talk about his lifelong journey of learning, and how he overcame self-doubt along the way.

Twenty-four Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) students from the Diploma in Child Psychology & Early Education (CPEE) will undergo a 22-week Enhanced Internship programme to strengthen understanding of theories through workplace, as part of the national SkillsFuture movement.

All the 24 students have also undergone a 10-week pre-internship preparatory process at their assigned preschools where they met their mentors weekly for in-class observation sessions. The pre-internship programme has helped students better prepare for their internships and build a stronger bond with their mentors. Other key enhancements include a longer duration to enhance opportunities for quality learning experiences and interactions with stakeholders, a more defined set of learning outcomes and structured mentoring. 

18 preschools have come on board as hosting centres to provide Enhanced Internships for the pioneer batch of students. 

This Enhanced Internship programme complements initiatives by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to attract and retain passionate early childhood professionals by providing them with realistic and meaningful experience in an early childhood setting that develops work-ready skills.

This strategic partnership, initiated by the joint commitment of the four SHGs, will allow schools to better support the holistic development of our students, especially students from less-advantaged backgrounds, by tapping on the community resources of the four SHGs.

SCCs provide care and support for students after school, and run programmes to meet the broad range of the students’ social, emotional, recreational, physical, intellectual and creative needs, and also a safe and nurturing environment for students, especially for those who lack home-based support after school hours.

“For the young, let me tell you, the sky has turned brighter. There’s a glorious rainbow that beckons those with the spirit of adventure, and there are rich findings at the end of that rainbow. To the young and to the not-so-old, I say, look at that horizon, follow that rainbow, go ride it. Not all will be rich; quite a few will find a grain of gold. Dig it up!”

The ASPIRE Committee was tasked to study how applied education in the polytechnics and ITE could be enhanced by:

Better matching students’ strengths and interests to applied education pathways to enable them to maximise their potential;
Exploring deeper school-industry collaborations so that polytechnic and ITE students can learn deep skills and enjoy better career progression; and
Enhancing industry partnerships to raise the quality of teaching and learning for polytechnic and ITE students.

The Committee recognised that education was very important to Singaporeans, who see it as key to unlocking the opportunities in life and assuring a good future. A diverse group of stakeholders including industry players, education leaders and government officials with a range of expertise and educational backgrounds was invited to participate in the review.

The form and co-form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of our pupils. During FTGP lessons, activities are conducted to allow for purposeful teacher-pupil interactions and for teachers to facilitate pupils' learning and equip them with Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. Such provision of positive school experiences leads to the creation of stable and positive teacher-pupil relationships.

In our efforts to develop the whole child, we focus largely on engaging the pupils. The FTGP lessons are designed to include the three main domains of cognition, emotion and action. FTGP lessons @ JWPS include the teaching of knowledge, skills and values, the opportunities for learning experiences and time for quality reflections.

We leverage on a variety of interesting interaction activities in the FTGP resource package to create a positive learning environment, promote opportunities for reflections, affirming good behaviours and inculcating values among the pupils.

Show your appreciation and support for the students participating in the SYF by sharing and liking this video!

First launched on 18 July 1967 at the Jalan Besar Stadium by the late President Yusof Ishak, the SYF has since become an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the achievements of our youths in the Co-Curricular Activities (CCA).

Over the years, the SYF has evolved to reflect the changing times. It has seen the involvement of more than 30,000 students in the activities and performances each year. The SYF has been a fiesta for honing of skills, building friendships, strengthening bonds and creating a common, shared experience for our youths.

Starting in April with the SYF Arts Presentations (formerly known as Central Judging) and culminating in a week-long of SYF Celebrations in July (formerly known as SYF Presentations and Outreach), the SYF will engage students from schools across Singapore in the Visual and Performing Arts CCAs. Students from primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges/Millennia Institute, get to showcase their artistic expression, teamwork and love for the performing arts. 

SYF Celebrations complements the Arts Presentation, and emphasises MOE's philosophy of student-centricity, enabling all talents to grow and develop to their full potential.

2014-07-12 08:55:32,Developing Values Through Dragonboating - Yuan Ching Secondary School,"Developing Values Through Dragon Boating

Being a team sport, Dragon Boating requires every member in the team to build on trust-based relationships based on integrity, compassion and loyalty. 

Dragon Boating also demands a high level of coordination, cooperation and collaboration from every team member to accomplish their mission. There are no 'star strikers' in Dragon Boating as every individual needs to play his or her part and be committed, dedicated and disciplined for the team to build and maintain high competition standards. 

Yuan Ching Secondary School achieved niche status for Dragon Boating as a Co-Curricular Activity in 2013 and shortly after being re-envisioned as the basis for the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), the ""Yuan Ching Dragon Boat"" CCA hopes to impart the school values of Integrity, Excellence, Compassion, Enterprise and Loyalty to the rest of the student body through hands-on experiential lessons in dragon boating.

Watch this video to see how Dragon Boating helps students develop values and overcome challenges!

2014-04-07 02:52:23,Excelling in Thinking Flexibly and Creatively to Solve Complex and Unfamiliar Problems,"According to the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) computer-based assessment of Problem Solving, Singapore's 15 year old students excel in thinking flexibility and creatively to solve complex and unfamiliar problems. The findings show that Singapore students are innovative, able to handle uncertainty, and dare to experiment with alternative solutions. These highly valued competencies stand them in good stead in a globalised, information-rich economy increasingly dominated by highly skilled, non-routine jobs, and give them the wherewithal to come together to create a brighter future for Singapore.

The strong performance of our students reflects the Singapore education system's curricular emphasis and our schools' efforts in developing problem solving skills in students.  Our broad and inclusive education system has also allowed us to bring out the best in every child. The results of PISA 2012 show that Singapore has one of the deepest and widest talent pools of students who have the ability to apply thinking skills effectively to solve problems. Our proportion of weaker or low performers in Problem Solving is also among the lowest of all participating education systems.

Watch this video of how Temasek Secondary School students are equipped with skills to solve problems not only within subject domains but also in general real-world contexts, through programmes like VEXA (Values Education through EXperiential Activities) and Financial Mathematics!

The vision for the school's music education programme is to develop every student to be able to ""aesthetically respond"" to music. Quality music education from Primary 1 to 6 is the school's strategy in grooming brass band talents and lifelong learners of music. This is supported by the school's eight Performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities -- Brass Band, String Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Choir, Malay dance, Chinese dance, Indian dance and Fusion dance. 

Students are encouraged to build a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of music. Besides learning specific skills such as singing, conducting and listening, students also experience playing in rhythm ensembles.

2014-04-21 09:34:13,Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) @ Queenstown Primary School,"Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) 

Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, and it is important for them to devote sufficient attention to their students' development. 

FTGPs provide time within the curriculum for form teachers to engage in quality interactions with their students and for them to help students strengthen their social and emotional competencies. During FTGPs, there could be play activities between the form teacher and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of social and emotional learning (SEL) skills.  

SEL teaches our students the need to handle themselves, relationships, and work, both effectively and ethically.

These skills include recognising and managing their emotions, developing care and concern for others, establishing positive relationships, making responsible decisions, and handling challenging situations constructively and ethically.

The SDMA seek to recognise students' creative works across a range of genres in video and animation production.  Co-organised by MOE and Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Film and Media Studies, this annual digital media production competition aims to provide students with a platform to creatively express themselves. Production work also offers each student-producer opportunities to develop project management, organisational and leadership skills, as they will be responsible for their own learning while creating content for the team, thereby promoting the development of 21st century competencies. 

To lend greater credence to the competition, the final judging for SDMA is usually conducted by a panel comprising experts in the media industry and educational sector. Entries for all categories are judged on their content, creativity, engagement and technical quality.

Many parents have given positive feedback on our school-based SSCs which have programmes designed in collaboration with schools to meet the broad range of child's social, emotional, recreational, physical, intellectual and creative needs, and to reinforce learning for students who need additional support.

As at December 2013, there are 80 school-based SCCs, a significant increase from less than 50 in 2011. The number of students enrolled in school-based centres has almost doubled, from around 3,500 to more than 6,500 in 2013.

MOE and MSF are also studying the capacity of SCC operators to expand the number of SCC places, both for community-based SCCs and school-based SCCs. Depending on their students' needs, schools can then decide on whether to set up an SCC in their school. Schools that do not have an SCC will continue to leverage community-based SCCs in their neighbourhood.

2014-02-27 01:56:58,School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR),"In recent years, the number of students diagnosed with dyslexia has increased by about 10% each year, in part due to greater awareness among parents and teachers, and better identification processes.

Students with dyslexia, who can cope with the demands of the mainstream environment should, as far as possible, attend our national schools, to benefit from a common educational experience with other Singaporeans. If given appropriate help early, these students can significantly overcome the literacy difficulties associated with dyslexia.

MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2.
The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. 

The preliminary findings from a pilot study in 2012 showed that students who had participated in the remediation programme had improved in their reading and spelling skills.

Watch this video to find out how the students learn and benefit from the programme!

Enabling Every Individual to Realise His or Her Potential 
As the economy evolves and the economic environment becomes more dynamic and complex, demand for a wider range of skills, competencies and expertise will increase. What are the skills and competences required to adapt and succeed?

There are multiple educational pathways that cater to the different strengths and interests of our students. To prepare and empower Polytechnic and ITE graduates to thrive in the economy of the future, the Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review (ASPIRE) Committee has been formed to review and recommend enhancements to the applied education model at the Polytechnics and ITE.

Chaired by Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education, the Committee will look at enhancing career and academic progression prospects for Polytechnic and ITE graduates through the strengthening of industry linkages to provide work-relevant training for students, enhanced educational and career guidance, and pursuit of industrial research, innovation and enterprise activities that support the Polytechnics and ITE's academic mission.

The review, which will involve the industry, students and other stakeholders, aims to present recommendations that will create significant impact for our Polytechnic and ITE system of education, and to better equip our young people to seize opportunities in the future.

Of these, five started operating in 2014 and are located within HDB heartlands - four located in primary schools (Blangah Rise Primary, Dazhong Primary, Farrer Park Primary and Punggol View Primary) and one in the community at Tampines Street 45. 
 
The curriculum in the pilot MOE Kindergartens will be guided by the principles spelt out in the refreshed Kindergarten Curriculum Framework (KCF), which aims to nurture children holistically. The teachers will use the teaching and learning resources developed by MOE. In line with the KCF, children in the pilot kindergartens will be engaged in learning through purposeful play to build their self-confidence, nurture their positive attitudes towards learning as well as develop their social, literacy and numeracy skills. All these will lay a strong foundation for their future learning.
 
In addition, the curriculum will have a distinctive Singapore content, using local themes, stories and songs that draw on things and experiences familiar to children. This will help them make meaningful connections across different learning areas. There will be ample opportunities for teachers to use local songs and dances to design music and movement activities to strengthen children's social and emotional, physical, language and cognitive development.

At Innova Primary, the school integrates the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into its curriculum to enhance learning and develop its students' competencies for the 21st Century.  

For example, during Physical Education (PE) lessons, teachers and students use the ""Coach's Eye"" application on a tablet to film and analyse the students' movements. Through slow-motion playback and other functions in the app, the PE teachers are able to review and provide instantaneous feedback on getting the techniques right and other areas for improvement.

At Haig Girl's School, the implementation of Holistic Assessment has progressed to the upper primary levels, where older children have taken greater ownership of their learning. They communicate their learning goals and plans to their teachers and parents and express how they wish to be supported during the Parent-Child-Teacher Conferencing (PCTC) sessions. The process of holistic assessment and feedback engages students more actively in decisions that affect their learning. It motivates them and gives them clear information about how they can improve their learning, developing them into confident and self-directed learners.

2014-02-12 03:19:15,School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme,"In recent years, the number of students diagnosed with dyslexia has increased by about 10% each year, in part due to greater awareness among parents and teachers, and better identification processes.

Students with dyslexia, who can cope with the demands of the mainstream environment should, as far as possible, attend our national schools, to benefit from a common educational experience with other Singaporeans. If given appropriate help early, these students can significantly overcome the literacy difficulties associated with dyslexia.

MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2.
The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. 

The preliminary findings from a pilot study in 2012 showed that students who had participated in the remediation programme had improved in their reading and spelling skills.

At Bedok View Secondary School, efforts are being made to level up the numeracy skills of low-progress students.  Teachers focus on addressing learning gaps and motivate these students by a variety of intervention strategies.  One of these strategies is to use concrete manipulatives, such as Algediscs, to relate to abstract operations in Algebra.  This method makes learning a more hands-on experience, and helps to build confidence and interest in Mathematics.  

This levelling up effort is being piloted in 14 primary schools and 15 secondary schools so as to extend support and help students achieve a higher level of competency in numeracy.

STELLAR aims to teach our children the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, enabling them to communicate effectively and confidently in the globalised world. For pupils who are weak in English literacy, LSP provides early intervention so they can catch up with their peers and access learning in the regular classroom.

Results of the 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) were encouraging. Singapore students emerged among the top few internationally and had made significant improvements through time. The results also showed that the percentage of students who performed below or just attained the 'low' benchmark decreased from 24% in 2001 to 13% in 2011 and the percentage of ""very highly competent"" students doubled from 12% to 24%.

Learning takes place beyond the textbooks as children are exposed to integrated learning experiences and are encouraged to cultivate care and concern for others.

Values education play an important role in shaping a child's character and ECHA gives an opportunity for students to be recognised for their commendable achievements in non-academic areas.
 
Schools, parents and the community have an important role to play in every child's life.  Together, we can work hand-in-hand to discover and unveil the hidden gem in each child and lead them to be successful individuals, ready to face the challenges of the 21st century!

How can children be helped to become better writers? From writing narratives to book reports and letters, many writing situations are presented to children, both in school and out of it. The digital world presents even more opportunities for children to write and to communicate their thoughts. Yet many children are reluctant writers, and their efforts are often run-of-the-mill. This seminar will explore strategies that parents with children in primary school can use to get their children hooked on writing, and make writing an enjoyable activity for both parent and child.

How can children be helped to become better writers? From writing narratives to book reports and letters, many writing situations are presented to children, both in school and out of it. The digital world presents even more opportunities for children to write and to communicate their thoughts. Yet many children are reluctant writers, and their efforts are often run-of-the-mill. This seminar will explore strategies that parents with children in primary school can use to get their children hooked on writing, and make writing an enjoyable activity for both parent and child.

Children have tremendous resources to support their own growth and development.  Too often, these resources are suppressed through neglect or inattention.   Parents can play an influential role in unlocking these potential for their children by becoming a solution-focused coach to them.

This seminar helps parents to explore ways to be that kind of strength-based coach, and hence, help their children gain insights on their own ability to cope with the challenges of their own growth and development.

WISE KIDS offers training programmes, consultancy and resource development in the areas of innovative use of digital/web technologies, digital literacy and safety. An older digital native with a PhD, Sangeet believes strongly in the potential of Internet and digital technologies to transform education, youth and community development, but believes that all stakeholders (government, organisations and individuals) need to actively develop digital literacy skills to use these technologies effectively and safely. Sangeet has delivered workshops and training programmes in the UK and internationally on these topics.

In this 4 part presentation for parents held as part of the MOE ExCEL Festival 2012, Sangeet introduces and explore how young people are using the Internet and digital technologies, their positive potential and the challenges they present to parents. The latter include a perceived loss of control over what their children access online; the risk of unsuitable online friends; a lack of understanding of what their children are doing online; establishing norms, boundaries and balance in the home; the issue of oversharing/ sharing sensitive information; a different understanding of privacy online; issues of behaviour and peer pressure; issues of younger children being exposed to inappropriate content and contact; issues of cyberbullying, sexting, scams, viruses, identity theft, eCrime, managing online privacy, reputation and identity.

How daunting it is to be a parent! To be responsible for another human being (or 5!), to love and raise him/her to be the adult we can be proud of -- one driven by values and motivated to be the best person he/she can be.

Yet parenthood in itself is an oxymoron -- joyful & painful, heartwarming & heartbreaking, fulfilling & depleting...but altogether a worthy and worthwhile calling. We want to raise our children as best we can, but we all realise it is not easy. Engaging them and being involved in their lives especially as the children grow older is proving quite a challenge. They are either uninterested or we are not their priority. How can we raise children who act on the values we have brought them up with? How can we fully engage them?

We want to raise our children as best we can, but we all realise it is not easy. Engaging them and being involved in their lives especially as the children grow older is proving quite a challenge. They are either uninterested or we are not their priority. How can we raise children who act on the values we have brought them up with? How can we fully engage them?

Why study so hard? 

Answer :  So you can get a good job in future .

Is this really true? And is this the reason why we put our children through schools and tuition classes? Children are hardly concerned about future job worries. So parents seem to be caught in a 'lose - lose' situation of having to push their children to academic excellence, and then having to face huge emotional problems when their children see them as the 'bad guys' who apply pressure and undue stress.

Dr Tan will share some of the struggles and successes of navigating his family through the educational ladder; asking the whys, whats and hows of trying to educate children better, and to think deeper about the importance of character formation versus the successful completion of worksheets.

But it can happen. In fact, 1 in 2 people who are healthy at the age of 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime. Therefore, it is important that we plan ahead for our healthcare needs as we age. 

ElderShield is a severe disability insurance scheme which helps Singaporeans with severe disabilities and their families cope with the financial demands of their daily care. Singaporeans who turn 40 are automatically enrolled in ElderShield, unless they opt out. It is an important component of Singapore’s social safety net and helps to prepare our future generations for their needs in old age.
