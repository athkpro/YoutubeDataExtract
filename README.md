# YoutubeDataExtract
This repo contains some functions I wrote to extract youtube data easily from a channel. Just enter the channel's name and the function will return a dataframe of 11 features (note that some cleaning works may need to be done)

Check out the juypter notebook for a sample. I also did some basic plots for bokeh for fun!
